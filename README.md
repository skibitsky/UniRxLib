# UniRxLib
UniRxLib is Unity external library of [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx).

Because UnityEngine.UI [is missing in some versions of Unity](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unityengine-dot-ui-reference-is-missing-in-assembly-definition-assemblies-and-plugins)
, this project has dependency on [UnityEngine.UI.dll NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity3D.UnityEngine.UI).

You can always use your own version of UnityEngine.dll ([documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingDLL.html)).

Tested in Unity 2019.1.7f1 and 2019.2.2f1 on macOS.
